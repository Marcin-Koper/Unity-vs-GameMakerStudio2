# Unity vs GameMakerStudio2

## Info

Both games were part of the thesis titled "Comparison between Unity Game Engine and GameMaker Studio Engine on the example of platformer game".

## Summary of the thesis

Comparison of two game engines such as Unity and GameMaker Studio was an object
of the thesis. At the beginning were described exactly what is a game, how it works. In
the next chapter the purpose of the thesis was described and the way of achieving this.
Next part was describing how a team of people which create a game (development
team) works, also what the game engine is, what the relations between the game
engine and game genre are, and how running game engine architecture looks like. All
layers were described, for example:
* Core Systems, is a layer which includes basic tools such as Assertions, Math library or memory management tools,
* Resource Manager this layer help access any of game assets.
* Rendering Engine is the biggest and most complex layer which is responsible for rendering two-dimensional or three-dimensional graphics,
* Gameplay Foundations, layer consists of a scripting system, dynamic game objects, event/messaging system, et cetera.
And also a few engines were described with their pros and cons moreover, the choice
of game engines was reasoned.
In the next part of the thesis, a process of creating games on Unity game engine and
GameMaker Studio 2 was described. There were compared processes of creating
game sprites, game code, animations, particles effects, and sound effects. The result
of this cooperation was that creating a game in GameMaker Studio is a lot easier than
creating a game in Unity. One reason for this is mode available in GameMaker Studio
called Drag and Drop (DnD) which allow creating a game without knowledge of any
programming languages. But also that Unity gives more capabilities and has the best
assets shop.
In the last part of the thesis, the benchmarks were made and both games on two
different PC setups were compared in terms of frames per second, RAM usage, GPU
usage, and CPU usage. The results of that test were as follows: frames per second in
both games were stable at 60 frames, in terms of RAM usage the results were very
similar, but when it comes to GPU and CPU usage, the game created on GameMakre
Studio 2 was better optimized. Reason for this could be that the game created on Unity
game engine despite the fact that it is a two-dimensional game, it is working in threedimensional space. In this chapter also screenshots from both games were compared.
The screenshots were almost identical.
At the end of thesis following conclusion was drawn: it is hard to say which engine is
better for creating a two-dimensional game, each one of game engines has pros and 
55
cons. For people starting with programming GameMaker Studio will be better, but for
someone who wants more advanced options from an engine Unity will be better. This
leads to the conclusion that the choice of a game engine depends mostly on
preferences game creator has.
